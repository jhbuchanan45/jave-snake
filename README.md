# jave-snake
Simple Snake game built in Java using JFrame

Start building from "Game.java"

Made using the example project at http://zetcode.com/javagames/snake/ as a reference, however many parts are different and in my opinion better, for example the snake and apple objects are split into their own files and random maths for the apple is done differently. Also the direction in which the snake is moving is now stored as a single integer called "head_dir" where 0 is up, 1 is left, 2 is right and 3 is left, as opposed to using 4 booleans which must each be changed when the direction is changed.

Design.pdf contains a copy of my notes used while building the project,
